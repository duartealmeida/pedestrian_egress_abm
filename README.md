# An agent-based model to simulate non-urgent egress from public open space mass events
An agent-based model implemented in the GAMA Platform to simulate non-urgent pedestrian egress using an extended Social Force Model (Helbing and Moln√°r) with group behavior based on the model presented by Moussaid et al (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010047#s4).

Highlights:
- Crowd simulation in open urban space mass events;
- Non-urgent evacuation;
- Social groups behavior modeling;
- Social retention modeling;
- Facilitate event decision-making;
- Runs on GAMA 1.8.1.
